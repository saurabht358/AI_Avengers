## Team Overview

Welcome to AI Avengers! We are a diverse and dynamic team participated in the TechNex24 Hackathon. Our team brings expertise in various domains, including AI/ML development, web development, app development, blockchain, and game development. We are excited to collaborate and create innovative solutions.

## Hackathon Topic

**Project**: Chatbot for Mining Industry Regulations

**Description**: Our project focuses on developing a chatbot capable of responding to text queries related to Acts, Rules, and Regulations applicable to the mining industry. We aim to provide a user-friendly interface for quick access to information, making compliance easier for mining professionals.

## Team Members
